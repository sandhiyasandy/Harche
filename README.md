# Harche - Huge data Analysis, Reporting and Caching for applications using the MapReduce framework 

  Which deals with Big data, and is developed using PYTHON as front end, HDFS, Spark SQL as back end. This application is basically concerned with fetching the required data and storing the details using HDFS. The main objective of HARCHE is to reduce the effort of the administrator in managing large amount of data.


## SCOPE FOR FURTHER ENHANCEMENT
 
  - A module from where entities can communicate
  - Future prediction of data using past and present data
  - Report mailing system can be used
  - This system can be enhanced as a simple mobile application, which provides notification and report
